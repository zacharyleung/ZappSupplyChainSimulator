I made two copies of the Buli facility from Chama district.
One copy is always accessible.
The second copy is not accessible for 6 months of the year,
from the beginning of October to the end of March.

This is the smallest possible test case to show the impact of
various policy parameters, in a setting which is similar to the
212-facility Zambia test case.
